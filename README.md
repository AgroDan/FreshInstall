# FreshInstall
This repo will just be a collection of notes of things I should install upon a fresh installation. I will add to this as I need to.

If you just started up a new instance of Kali, to get it to a "proper working setup" that I've come to like, simply run the following command from a terminal:

`curl -sL https://raw.github.com/AgroDan/FreshInstall/master/setup-kali.sh | sudo bash`

This should get you on your way.
